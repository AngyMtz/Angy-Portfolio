Homework 02: Porfolio of Norma Martinez
March 21, 2021
Norma Angelica Martinez Lagarda

In this project I attempted to complete the acceptance criteria for this week's assignment MY PORFOLIO

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I created a portfolio that matches the mockup as closely as possible.  These are the criteria I was able to accomplish:

1. When loading the profile you will be presented with the developer's name, recent photo and links to sections about them, their work and how to contact them

2. When hovering over the applications image they are highlighted just as in the markup

3. When clicking on the images, they are dummy links.  As of right now I do not have any applications to showcase

Unable to Accomplish:

1. I was unable to successfully make an anchor link that would link to another part of the page.

2. When resizing the page, part of it is responsive and other parts are not.
